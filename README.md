## Overview

R2G is an advanced dashboard application designed to address the challenges of gathering and understanding refugee needs in a data-driven, bottom-up approach. This powerful tool leverages data from open Telegram channels used by Ukrainian refugees, providing policymakers and public sector agencies with valuable insights to make informed decisions. R2G employs advanced techniques, such as topic modeling and a chatbot interface powered by GPT-4, to assess and interact with refugee data. The result is a comprehensive platform that empowers stakeholders to better serve refugee populations while respecting their privacy.

### Key Technical Features

- **Data Gathering:** R2G scrapes messages from diverse Telegram channels utilized by Ukrainian refugees, ensuring a constant stream of relevant and up-to-date information.

- **Multilingual Analysis:** Utilizing the BERTopic algorithm, R2G processes multilingual data, enabling it to cluster text in various languages, including Ukrainian, Russian, German, and English.

- **Chatbot Interaction:** R2G incorporates the GPT-4 API to facilitate user interactions with the refugee data. Users can ask questions about specific topics, geolocations, and date ranges, with the chatbot retrieving relevant information from the database.

- **Interactive Dashboard:** The application offers an interactive website where stakeholders can explore and analyze refugee needs from a bottom-up perspective, applying data-driven intelligence.
